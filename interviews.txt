After college, I would like to join the Peace Corps, and I hope to one day start my own charter school with a focus on education reform.

I love writing fiction - short stories and such. I also love music - I sing, play a little guitar and fiddle around on the keyboard. I plan on gardening and hiking this spring and summer. 

what books do you recommend for adults?

I'm currently reading Americanah by Chimimanda Adichie and One Hundred Years of Solitude by Gabriel Garcia Marquez

My favorite children's book is "The Book with No Pictures" by B.J. Novak. It's a hoot!

Logan Christine Smith

Hi, I'm Logan Smith!

have you always lived in Shelbyville?

Yes, I grew up here!

Will you tell us a bit about yourself?

I'm currently a senior at Shelby County High School. I live with my mom, dad, brother, and two dogs. 
In the fall I'm going to attend the University of Kentucky and I'll be majoring in Computer Science. 

what do you like to do when you're not at work?

I'm usually out running around with friends. We go to the park or try to find a concert or something fun. I play a lot of video games, eat a lot of food. I hang out at the coffee shop quite a bit as well. So you'll probably see me there even when I'm not working!

what books do you recommend for adults?

Frankenstein by Mary Shelley and The Road by Cormac McCarthy are both very good. 

what about for kids?

I remember Junie B. Jones being my favorite book series when I was younger! It was so cute!

what music are you into right now?

I'm into stuff ranging from soft indie to loud pop punk. Classic rock is one of my favorite genres ever. 
Right now, my favorite artists include: Keaton Henson, Joyce Manor, The 1975, and Johnny Cash. 

what do you like most about working at sixth and main?

I've loved the atmosphere of Sixth and Main since I walked in for the first time a few years ago. It feels like a second home! I've made a ton of friends while hanging around and it's so cool meeting all of the locals!

current favorite drink?

The Caramel macchiato will always have a special place in my heart along with the Dirty Chai.









Tommy Hynes

Hey! I'm Tommy O'Hynes!

have you always lived in Shelbyville?

I have indeed!

Will you tell us a bit about yourself?

I'm 20 years old, and currently commuting to IUS, I record lots of music, constantly talk about deadlifts and watch lots of movies!

what do you like to do when you're not at work?

I like to procrastinate with my homework! I also spend a lot of time playing guitar and recording on my Mac, run a baseball sabermetrics blog and lift weights at the FAC and Shelby County Power and Fitness.

what books do you recommend for adults?

Freedom by Jonathan Franzen is fantastic. The Millennium series (Girl With the Dragon Tattoo, etc) by Stieg Larsson is another a great read. I'm also a sucker for John Green, even though he's considered young adult. Check out Looking For Alaska!

what about for kids?

The Harry Potter series holds up remarkably well. A Series of Unfortunate Events is great too, especially if you want your child to be as cynical and hardened as possible.

what music are you into right now?

I'm very into extremes and technicality, so my two favorite genres are death metal and 40's-50's bebop and jazz. I'm also a big fan of Latin and gypsy music. My top artists right now are probably Rings of Saturn, Charlie Parker, Stochelo Rosenberg and The Dillinger Escape Plan.

what do you like most about working at sixth and main?

Free coffee!!! I also really enjoy working with people. I like the feeling of improving someone's day by spending the extra time to make sure their latte is exactly how they requested, or that their cappuccino has the right amount of foam. I take a lot of pride in my regulars looking forward to seeing me to start their day.

current favorite drink?

I'm a big fan of Iced Americanos at the moment. It's a good way to quickly ingest a quad shot, and it's delicious with a pump or two of Irish Cream (the all ages version, of course). And of course, every baristas favorite drink, the cappuccino. I'm always working on my foam building, and welcome all challengers to a cappuccino duel!
